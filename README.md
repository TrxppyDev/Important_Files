These are a few FiveM Files you may need for vehicles in your FiveM server. This includes:

- carvariations.meta
- handling.meta
- vehicles.meta

As of now I have one more I need to add to this so it'll be out soon if it isn't already. I have a discord up and running soon for development so DM me @k2_trxppy on discord if you need anything!

TAKE NOTE:

Where it says "SPAWN CODE HERE", this must be replaced by your vehicles spawn code! If it does not have one then don't add these files to anything. It will mess your server up.
Also, don't remove any "#" these are added for extra notes although due to the fact they are hashed, your server scripting system should read right over it. If it doesn't remove the hashed text!

Don't DM me complaining if you've fucked somethin'

Thanks :)
